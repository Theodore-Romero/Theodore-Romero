## Hi, I’m Theodore 👋

I’m a business-focused data professional with an MBA and hands-on experience building dashboards, data pipelines, and automated workflows.  
I like working at the intersection of business questions and technical systems — turning messy data into something decision-ready.

Most of my recent projects are self-directed and built to demonstrate practical, job-relevant skills rather than toy examples.
